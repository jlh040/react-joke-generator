# React Joke Generator

### Information

- This code is my solution to **Springboard exercise 41.3.12**. 
- The app itself is a joke generator. When the page loads, 10 jokes are displayed on the screen, along with thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to add or remove votes to the jokes. A button is displayed at the top to request new jokes.
- The original code was written using React hooks and functions components. I was tasked with changing the code to use class based components.
- Check out my [commit history](https://github.com/jlh040/react-joke-generator/commits/master) to see how I was able to transform the app to only use classes!
